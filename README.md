## What does this project stand for?
It is an simple web application to publish articles, view them in various formats and to provide basic CRUD features. I developed this web application as part of an assessment for a *Java Developer* position at [Cefalo](https://www.cefalo.com/en/) in 2016, leading to a job offer from them. It can act as a good short tutorial for candidates anticpating similar positions in industry.
